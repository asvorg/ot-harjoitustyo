# Password manager

This project is a password manager. It can generate a random password, or hash and store a password provided by the user. The passwords are stored either locally, or ~~on the internet~~. The password manager supports multiple users, and the passwords are stored securely, not visible to other users.

## Planned functionality

- ~~Storing passwords provided by users~~
- ~~Generating secure passwords for users~~
- ~~Option to store either locally~~, or remotely
- ~~Supports multiple users~~

### Ideas for further development

- Possible 2FA for the master password
- GUI
